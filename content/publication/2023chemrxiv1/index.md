abstract: The mechanism of Pb(IV) promoted phenol oxidative dearomatization reaction has been traditionally attributed to a carbocation mechanism. In 2011, Pettus reported an oxidative dearomatization reaction leading to a mixture of a formal [5+2] and a Câ€“O bond formation product. By employing density functional theory (DFT) and quasi-molecular dynamics calculations, it was demonstrated that the reaction does not occur through a carbocation intermediate, but instead proceeds through an addition-coupled electron transfer (ACET) mechanism. Moreover, the ACET exhibits ambimodality, wherein a transition state results in 4 ~ 6 distinct outcomes through post-TS bifurcation. The reported selectivity can be effectively rationalized by the newly proposed mechanism.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Brand new chemistry in old reactions."
