abstract: The formal hydrogen transfer from single atom catalyst to unsaturated compounds is of great interest in the catalysis research. With the hydrogen transfer from metalloporphyrin hydride (MPcH, M = Fe, Co) to imines as an example, we have shown that this reaction is an addition coupled electron transfer (ACET) reaction instead of a hydride transfer, by combining density functional theory (DFT), multireference calculations, intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis and substituent effect study. The ACET mechanism is universe in both low-polar solvent (dichloromethane) and high-polar protic solvent (2-propanal). The barrier versus Hammett substituent constant relationship under dichloromethane solvation features a volcano-like shape, in which both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups accelerates the reaction. While the structure-reactivity relationship cannot be rationalized by either substituent constant σp or the spin delocalization constant σJJ, it can be successfully explained by a theoretical model of ACET proposed by us for the first time in this work. This work shows that ACET may be ubiquitous in single atom catalyzed addition reactions.
